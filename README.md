TERRAPLANIST NIGHTMARE


This is a canvas based game, where a terraplanist will have to dodge falling science books, terrestrial globes, and other related stuff. In this game, if you loose you win and you can shoot bullshit arguments to the falling objects in order to destroy them. The score names will be named DonkeyPoints and there will be a limited time to play.
